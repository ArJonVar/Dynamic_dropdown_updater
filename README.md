# Dynamic_dropdown_updater

This is script looks for directions from the ConductorV2 (a smartsheet at https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/wr7wcHpqpFvJ6Q3574VQhvvw47H7rm7JPjmf4H21?view=grid)
it then updates each smartsheet dropdown column that is on the ConductorV2 so that its dropdown options match the current list of values in the source column.
This script can handle four situations for the destination column, dropdown, multi dropdown, contact list, and multi contact list
